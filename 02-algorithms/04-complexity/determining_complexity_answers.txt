1. O(1), simply printing out the input, always going to take the same time
2. O(n), as the size of input increases, the number of operations executed grows at the same rate
3. O(n), as the size of input increases, the number of operations executed grows at the same rate
4. O(2^n), every time the function runs, there will be 2 recursive calls
5. O(n), as the size of input increases, the number of operations executed grows at the same rate
6. O(n^2), seems like a quick sort, quick sort has a worst case performance of O(n^2)
