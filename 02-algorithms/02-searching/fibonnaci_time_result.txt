1. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.
  cannot use recursive for unsorted, so I would use iterative

2. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.
  since sorted, I would choose recursive
  recursive would take shorter time because for each iteration, the amount of collection
  will be halved and the number of items to look through will decrease
