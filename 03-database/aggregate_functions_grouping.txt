Create a database called iron-bank-foundation.
Create a donations table, and import CSV data from this file.
Select the following data from the table:

  a. SELECT SUM(amount) FROM donations;
  b. SELECT SUM(amount) AS total_donation, donor FROM donations GROUP BY donor;
  c. SELECT AVG (amount) AS avg_donation, donor FROM donations GROUP BY donor;
  d. SELECT COUNT (amount) FROM donations WHERE amount > 100;
  e. SELECT MAX (amount) FROM donations;
  f. SELECT MIN (amount) FROM donations;


Correct the following SELECT statement:

  SELECT SUM (amount) AS total_amount, id
  FROM payment
  GROUP BY id
  HAVING total_amount > 200;


Write queries to retrieve the following information.

  a. SELECT * FROM cats ORDER BY intake_date;
  b. SELECT * FROM adoptions ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 5;
  c. SELECT * FROM cats WHERE gender = female AND age >= 2;
  d. SELECT SUM(amount) AS total_donation, donor FROM donations GROUP BY donor ORDER BY total_donation DESC LIMIT 5;
  e. SELECT SUM(amount) AS total_donation, donor FROM donations GROUP BY donor ORDER BY total_donation DESC OFFSET 5 LIMIT 10;
