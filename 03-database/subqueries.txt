Given a dogs table, adoptions table, adopters table, and volunteers table,
write queries to retrieve the following information.
All tables are described below.

1. Create a list of all volunteers. If the volunteer is fostering a dog, include each dog as well.

  SELECT v.name, d.dog_name
  FROM volunteers AS v,
  (SELECT name AS dog_name FROM dogs WHERE in_foster = true) AS d;

2. List the adopter’s name and the pet’s name for each animal adopted within the past month
to be displayed as a ‘Happy Tail’ on social media.

  SELECT dog, adopter
  FROM adoptions
  WHERE date > 2017-11-30 AND date < 2018-01-01;

3. Create a list of adopters who have not yet chosen a dog to adopt and generate
all possible combinations of adopters and available dogs.

  SELECT name FROM volunteers WHERE available_to_foster = true
  CROSS JOIN (SELECT name AS dog_name FROM dogs WHERE in_foster = false);

4. Display a list of all cats and all dogs who have not been adopted.

  SELECT d.dog_name, c.cat_name
  FROM (SELECT dogs.name AS dog_name WHERE dogs.in_foster = false) AS d,
  (SELECT cats.name AS cat_name WHERE cats.adoption_date = null) AS c;


5. Create a list of volunteers who are available to foster.
If they currently are fostering a dog, include the dog.
Also include all dogs who are not currently in foster homes.

  SELECT v.name, d.dog_name, e.no_foster_dog
  FROM (SELECT name FROM volunteers WHERE available_to_foster = true) AS v,
  (SELECT name AS dog_name FROM dogs WHERE in_foster = true) AS d,
  (SELECT name AS no_foster_dog FROM dogs WHERE in_foster = false) AS e;
