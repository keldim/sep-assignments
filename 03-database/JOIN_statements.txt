Change this query so that you are using aliasing:

  SELECT p.name, c.salary, c.vacation_days
  FROM professor AS p
  JOIN compensation AS c
  ON p.id = c.professor_id;

Build an Employees table and a Shifts table with appropriate primary and foreign keys.
Then, write queries to find the following information:

a. SELECT * FROM employees;
   SELECT * FROM shifts;

b. SELECT * FROM employees CROSS JOIN shifts;

Hey abraham, so i tried to answer the remaining questions at the checkpoint, but i could not find the
tables that the questions were referring to. I tried to answer the questions without the tables,
but it became too confusing to answer without any data...

Do you have access to the tables? If you can find them, could you send them to me? I will try to answer
the questions again with the data.
