1. when the size of the array is small, doubling the size won't be a big deal,
but as the size increases and the array continues to double due to collision,
the array will use too much of the computer's memory

2. doubling the size is a slow operation

3. doubling the size leads to fragmentation because
there is an excess space relative to the actual data and the data will be scattered
