I expected tree to take a longer time to insert, find, delete than heap because I thought heap had a more simpler
structure of because it simply put smaller data on either left or right while tree would put smaller one on the left and bigger one on the right.


but heap took longer on the benchmark test.
this might be because of inefficient code that I wrote for the heap.

I think tree will be used when the data structure and organization
is more important than storing and finding data fast.
heap will be used to store and find data fast.
